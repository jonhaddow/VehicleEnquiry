  "body": "# Vehicle Enquiry API\r\n\r\nThis is a project experimenting different technologies and services available to create an Vehicle Enquiry API. I'm using the [Dropwizard](http://www.dropwizard.io/0.9.2/docs/) framework on Java. \r\n\r\nThe API is exposed on port 8050 and accessed by this URL:\r\n\r\nhttp://HOST:8050/vehicles?vrn=VEHICLE_REG&make=VEHICLE_MAKE\r\n\r\nTwo parameters are passed in to the URL: \r\n- The vehicle registration number\r\n- The vehicle make\r\n\r\n\r\n## Hosting on AWS\r\n\r\n### Creating a Docker image\r\n\r\nA Docker image was created to hold the Jar file and it's configuration files. \r\nI have uploaded this to my [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) repo.\r\n\r\nTo create a Docker image of the API (on *Windows 10*) you:\r\n\r\n- Install [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox)\r\n- Copy the executional .jar file, the .yml file and the Dockerfile into the Docker folder.\r\n- Open *Docker Quickstart Terminal*\r\n- Navigate to the docker folder\r\n- Type ``` docker build .```\r\n- Type ``` docker images ``` to find the image you just created. Copy the imageID.\r\n- Type ``` docker tag imageID DockerhubUsername/ImageName ```\r\n- Type ``` docker login https://index.docker.io/v1/ ``` and login with your credentials.\r\n- type ``` docker push DockerhubUsername/ImageName ```\r\n\r\nYour API is now in your Docker hub repo.\r\n\r\n### Using Amazon's ECS\r\n\r\n*This is not included in free tier.*\r\n\r\nAmazon ECS uses Docker images in task definitions to launch containers on EC2 instances. \r\n\r\nThis can be done by:\r\n\r\n- creating a task definition\r\n- specifying a container name\r\n- referencing the created image URL in the Docker Hub repo\r\n- and adding the required port mapping (8050:8050)\r\n\r\nYou may also need to change the rules of the security group the EC2 instance is using to allow 8050 inbound calls.",
